Playing around to learn functional programming in F# 

## The game
It is a console based 21 card game simulator. Choose the number of players and the application will present the results.
The frame of the application is based on the rules for this [assignment](https://github.com/1dv021/examination-2) which is an exam for testing new developers on OO style javascript. I thought it would be interesting to see the difference between my two solutions. Unfortunately, since it is an assignment I can't make my solution in javascript public.

### Changes from the assignment
I've added the possibility to dynamically decide the number of players when playing the game.

### Output

### Try it
1. Install F#
 - [mac](https://fsharp.org/use/mac/)
 - [Windows](https://fsharp.org/use/windows/)
 - [Linux](https://fsharp.org/use/linux/)
2. Fork or clone this project
3. Run `dotnet run` in the root folder

## Suggestions
As I've mentioned this is my first time testing F# so I'm sure there is a lot of improvements that can be made. Please create an issue or a pull request if you have any improvement or suggestion on how to improve the code or structure.
