Playing around to learn functional programming in F# 

## The game
It is a consoled based 21 card game simulator. Choose the number of players and the application will present the results.
The frame of the application is based on the rules for this [assignment](https://github.com/1dv021/examination-2) which is a test for testing new developers on OO style javascript. I thought it would be interesting to see the differens between my two solutions. Unfortunatly, since the it is an assignemnt I can't make my solution in javascript public.

### Changes from the assignemnt
I've added the possibilty to dynamically decide the number of players when playing the game.
